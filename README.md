<sub>*Data Scientist*</sub>

I'm a control and automation engineer graduated from UFMG in 2017. I'm finishing up my Masters in Computational Intelligence, and since 2019 I'm immersing myself in data science and machine learning. I also have 4 years of professional experience as a Software Developer Analyst. 

During my data science studies, I've been studying all stages of developing business models solutions. Starting by understanding the business problem until deploying the model solution using Clouds.

I have already developed solutions for important business problems such as predict stores sales - by regression methods - and a deep exploratory analisys over housing market.

The details of each solution are described in the projects below.

## Data Science Projects:

### [Housing Market Speculation](https://github.com/Leonamrsm/Real_State_Insights)

In this project, I analyzed over 20k houses in Seattle city. I Speculated which houses the company should buy, which were the best renovation upgrades to do and when to sell them.

Based on the defined property purchase and sale strategies, the estimated total profit would be **$322,179,949.50**.

i also created a online dashboard to vizualize the principal insights, facilitating data visualization and business decisions, and answer the business questions, estimating the profit that can be made.

### [Store Sales Prediction](https://github.com/Leonamrsm/Rossmann-Stores-Sales-Forecast)

In this project, I developed a Machine Learning model able to predict 1115 stores sales for the next 6 week sales, **with an average 11% MAPE**. using XGBoost regressor, with informations over 1115 stores trough 942 days.

considering the model error, in the best scenario, **287,609,874.99** sales are forecast.

I also created a Telegram chatbot. Which return the expected, worst and best sales scenarios daily sales evolution graphs, for each store in the next 6 weeks.
