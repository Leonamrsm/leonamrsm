# Leonam Rezende
<sub>*Data Scientist*</sub>

I have a Bachelor's Degree in Control and Automation Engineering from the Federal University of Minas Gerais. I also have a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering, in the area of Computational Intelligence, also from the Graduate Program in Electrical Engineering at UFMG.

I have an interdisciplinary profile and I am interested in mathematics and statistics and computer science, which led me to the world of data science.

During my data science studies, I've been studying all stages of developing business models solutions. Starting by understanding the business problem until deploying the model solution.


The details of each solution are described in the projects below.

## Some Data Science Projects:

### [Efficiency of Sound Wave Fire-Extinguishers](https://github.com/Leonamrsm/Efficiency-of-Sound-Wave-Fire-Extinguishers)




### [Risk-Analysis-in-Public-Transport](https://github.com/Leonamrsm/Risk-Analysis-in-Public-Transport)

Which traffic incidents occur most frequently? What age group is most involved in traffic incidents? What is the most common event in incidents? Are passengers or pedestrians the main victims of incidents?

These and other questions are the focus of analysis in this project, where we provide insights through the examination of publicly available real data. 

Apache Spark was used to read and process data efficiently, simulating data processing in a distributed cluster of computers. Apache SQL was employed to manipulate and query the data for further analysis. In addition, the power of Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, Plotly and Matplotlib were used to create informative and visually appealing graphs to visualize the findings.


### [Housing Market Speculation](https://github.com/Leonamrsm/Real_State_Insights)

In this project, I analyzed over 20k houses in Seattle city. I Speculated which houses the company should buy, which were the best renovation upgrades to do and when to sell them.

Based on the defined property purchase and sale strategies, the estimated total profit would be **$322,179,949.50**.

i also created a online dashboard to vizualize the principal insights, facilitating data visualization and business decisions, and answer the business questions, estimating the profit that can be made.


### [Store Sales Prediction](https://github.com/Leonamrsm/Rossmann-Stores-Sales-Forecast)

In this project, I developed a Machine Learning model able to predict 1115 stores sales for the next 6 week sales, **with an average 11% MAPE**. using XGBoost regressor, with informations over 1115 stores trough 942 days.

considering the model error, in the best scenario, **287,609,874.99** sales are forecast.

I also created a Telegram chatbot. Which return the expected, worst and best sales scenarios daily sales evolution graphs, for each store in the next 6 weeks.
